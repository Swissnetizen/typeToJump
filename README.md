# type to jump
I made this game in 29 days, (not including the time taken to write this post).
It was based off an idea from /r/gameideas. 
The central game mechanic is typing words to jump. 
As usual, this game is made for #1GAM.

This time around I found translating it into Esperanto and French very difficult as many of the puzzles revolve around English spelling irregularities or length. 
That's why the French and Esperanto translations may be lacking in some areas. 
Sorry for that! 
But in general the translations are OK*. 
The Esperanto translation is more complete than the French, though. 
Kamparano is currently trying to fix the Esperanto translation (but he hasn't sent his revised files yet).

Unfortunately I haven't switched to `systemJS` yet, but I think I'll take a break from gamedev and learn how to do it. 
Deploying the game itself was much easier because of my new makefile and the fact that itch.io accepts .zip files. 
The other reason that I've deployed it to itch.io is because my game's width is too large for my site and would break the design.

# Technology Stack
The technology stack is the same as before, Phaser and a makefile, but the code is transpiled from CoffeeScript.
The levels are made in Tiled and exported as JSON.
# Copying

The code for the game is licensed under the GNU General Public Licence, version 3 or later.
The assets are under CC-BY-SA and the level files are not open source.
